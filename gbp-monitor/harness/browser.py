"""Playwright browser lifecycle ONLY.

Per GBP_MONITOR_PLAN.md Section 5.2, this module is responsible for launching
a headless Chromium browser with a realistic user agent + viewport, and
returning the handles the caller needs to drive and tear it down. No scraping
logic lives here — that belongs to `harness/capture.py` and `harness/scroll.py`.

The caller is responsible for closing the context/browser and stopping the
Playwright instance. The recommended pattern is:

    p, browser, context = get_browser_context()
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        context.close()
        browser.close()
        p.stop()

ANTI-BOT HARDENING (added Fix A, 2026-07-20):

Prior to Fix A this module launched `headless=True` Chromium and overrode only
the `user_agent` string. That combination is empirically insufficient: per
arXiv:2606.14525 (Gundelach, Mühlhauser, Herrmann, Jun 2026) §5.3, the
`sec-ch-ua` Client Hints header exposes `"HeadlessChrome"` as a brand value in
Chromium's headless mode, and "75% of Chromium-headless-only blocks are caused
by header-level signals alone". Our own live-mode smoke test (CHANGELOG
2026-07-20T08:30:30) already empirically confirmed `SelectorNotFoundError` on
a real Google Maps URL — consistent with either stale selectors OR a bot
interstitial served to the detected headless client.

Fix A overrides the `sec-ch-ua` family of Client Hints via THREE complementary
mechanisms (because Playwright 1.57 Python's `new_context` does NOT expose a
single `user_agent_client_hints` kwarg — that's the Node.js API; verified
against the installed package's actual signature, per Rule 3):

  1. `extra_http_headers` on the context — pins the outgoing `sec-ch-ua*`
     HTTP headers. This is what server-side bot detection (Cloudflare, Akamai,
     Google) actually reads. Fixes the network-layer leak.
  2. CDP `Network.setUserAgentOverride` with `userAgentMetadata` — this is
     the Chromium DevTools Protocol method referenced in chromium:40768416
     (the bug report cited in the Fix A research). It makes the browser's
     INTERNAL client-hints state self-consistent, so any first-request edge
     case where `extra_http_headers` hasn't applied yet still sends the right
     values. It also populates `navigator.userAgentData` on the JS side.
  3. `add_init_script` to patch `navigator.userAgentData` — belt-and-
     suspenders for the JS-side read, in case a future Chromium version
     changes how `Network.setUserAgentOverride` propagates to the JS API.

This is a zero-cost, Rule-4-compliant fix that addresses the empirically-
identified leak. All three mechanisms claim the SAME identity (Chrome 124 on
Windows) — a mismatch between them would itself be a bot-detection signal,
because real browsers always send a self-consistent identity across all
layers.

Note on why we do NOT use playwright-stealth (Fix C, documented non-action):
per arXiv:2606.30119 §6.2, "Stealth or undetected modes do not significantly
reduce detectability" — modern bot detection operates at the TLS (JA4) and IP
layers, which JS-level stealth plugins cannot touch. Adding playwright-stealth
would be Rule 5 fake progress. The comment is here so a future agent does not
reintroduce the idea.
